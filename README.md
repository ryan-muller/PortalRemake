# PortalRemake
 My attempt to create the portals from Portal. So they can be used to traverse puzzles 
 
 I use a lot from Sebastian Lague's portal video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWpFZbjtSQg) to get things like recursion and clone spawning to work. 
 
 The portal shader was made by me, I manually converted several portal shaders I found into the shader graph in unity. Also adding my own visual effect to the portals using voronoi noise.
 
 I have also added my own features to the portal, such as velocity being amplified if you move through a portal above a certain speed. This makes crossing gaps easier when using the portals to fling yourself.
 
 
 I have 3 main additions I still want to make to this code.
1) I would like the transitions to different angles to be smoother and make more sense so you are less disorientated when going through a portal at a drastically different angle. 
2) Improve how other objects work when moving through the portal. I'd like to be able to push a cube through the portal like in the game. 
3) Improve the visuals by adding textures and a UI
